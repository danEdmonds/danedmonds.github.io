**With over a decade of experience,** my creativity and appreciation for web standards complement my meticulous attention to detail and writing creative markup. I transition comfortably between front-end and back-end environments, thriving on moving projects from conception to launch.

I’m currently a **user experience designer** at [West Virginia University Health Sciences](https://health.wvu.edu). As member of the web team, I conceptualize and build web experiences using quality, hand-crafted, reusable components while pushing the boundaries of the set brand patterns.

I appreciate simplicity and user centered design, taking particular delight in microinteractions and using motion to guide users. **I’m eager to break habits and learn new things.**
