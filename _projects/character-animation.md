**I love animation** and using motion to communicate and guide an audience. I wanted to truly understand and apply the fundamentals of animation in my own work, and I found that character animation is one of the toughest forms of animation to learn and become proficient at.

In Fall 2022, I enrolled in the 18-month 3D character animation program at [Animation Mentor](https://www.animationmentor.com/) where I completed the **animation basics**, **body mechanics**, and **advanced body mechanics** courses. I obtained a firm grasped on the 12 principles of animation and how to apply these principles to animating 3d character.

While I havenâ€™t been able to complete the program, I've gained an invaluable skillset and an intracate eye that I apply to any animation I'm working on moving forward.
