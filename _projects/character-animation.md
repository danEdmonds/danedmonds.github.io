**I love animation and using motion** to communicate and guide an audience.

I wanted to truly understand and apply the fundamentals of animation in my own work, and I found that character animation is one of the toughest forms of animation to learn and become proficient at.

In Fall 2022, I enrolled in the 18-month 3D character animation program at Animation Mentor where I completed the **animation basics**, **body mechanics**, and **advanced body mechanics** courses. I obtained a firm grasped on the 12 principles of animation and how to apply these principles to animating 3d character.

The experience was exillerating but, unfortunately, life got in the way and I havenâ€™t been able to complete the program. I gained an invaluable skillset and eye for intrecanceis that I apply to any animation I'm working on moving forward.
