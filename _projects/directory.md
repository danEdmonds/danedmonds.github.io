A comprehensive profile is maintained for each staff member, faculty member, and associated patient care provider in the [WVU Health Sciences Directory](https://directory.hsc.wvu.edu/).

Crafting in the browser, I collaborated with the creative director and the WVU Health Sciences Communications team to iterate over several versions of high-fidelity prototypes to equip members and providers with a beautiful and reliable platform to highlight their professional achievements and interests.

Users swiftly and effectively discover members using a search feature that retrieves and queries data from an internal API fed from a custom-built Directory Manager web application.
