The WVU Health website focuses on West Virginia University’s health education and patient care initiatives by highlighting the unique culture within the five health schools and the advanced technology and practices being used. 

We collaborated with the WVU Health Sciences Communications team to create a visual design that feels innovative and agile, and that breaks through the traditional structure of a higher education website. Bold typography, in-the-moment photos, and concise sections ensure that every page layout feels as impactful as its content, with an emphasis on using animation to guide the audience throughout.

A collaborative approach to design, development, and content strategy ensured that WVU Health's priorities are at the focus of every decision.

I built a modular design system of adjustable components that fit together beautifully to efficiently create both captivating storytelling layouts and common templates. This design system is continuously growing and evolving by adding new components and expanding upon existing ones.

This design system is continuously used as the foundation for building microsites under the WVU Health umbrella, creating an ecosystem of WVU Health properties that share one sustainable and growing collection of modular and extendable components. Building microsites often spurs new unique components along with expanding upon and evolving existing components to create new variations.

## The cover.

Referred to as the "cover", editors choose from various layout options to focus on a single prominent item on the homepage supported by a large, engaging photo or video montage. The cover often serves as a playground to try out new and unique layouts and components.
