We worked with the WVU Health Sciences Communications team to organize and present the University’s health and wellness resources across several related microsites. Building upon the WVU Health design system, we unified the digital experiences to promote awareness and to help students, staff, and patients find the appropriate resources.

On the Paths to Well-being page, visitors are able to search and filter more than 100 health and wellness resources by name, audience, priority, and service. To create the most robust results possible, analytics are used to identify common search words and clicked items. 

Seasonally, the cards at the top of this page are updated to highlight the most popular resources, each linking to a pre-filtered list of resources.

## COVID-19 awareness

When the COVID-19 pandemic occured in March 2020, we were tasked with building a comprehenisble and flexible microsite capable of quickly communicating information that was rapidly changing day-to-day. 

The clear solution was to utilize the modularity of the newly created WVU Health design system to quickly build an informative, engaging, and scalable website.
