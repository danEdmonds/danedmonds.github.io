[Spotlights](https://health.wvu.edu/spotlight/) are a way for the WVU Health Sciences Communications team to highlight their editorial content about events and notable stories.

I created an engaging template with a very concise headline and summary, a large in-the-moment photo, and a space to highlight up to three supporting resources, as well as the ability to link to other related spotlights. This makes it easy for the editor to create a topical page that educates and inspires, and that can be shared on the WVU Health cover and across social media.
