Spotlight pages are a way for the WVU Health Sciences Communications team to highlight their editorial content about events and notable stories.

I created an engaging template with a very concise headline and summary, a large in-the-moment photo, and a space to use cards to highlight up to three supporting resources, as well as the ability to link to other related spotlights. This makes it easy for the editor to create a topical page that educates and inspires, and that can be shared on the WVU Health cover page and across social media.
