As one of the largest websites at West Virginia University, the focus of the School of Medicine homepage is to welcome a broad audience to the school and efficiently guide them to the information they need.

## Finding departments and programs.

We collaborated with the school’s communications team to build a robust list of everything that the school has to offer and the relationships between every department, program, major, and specialty training program. Visitors are able to search and filter more than 160 items by area of interest, degree level, campus, keyword and more.

## Program information.

Structured and focused templates provide smaller groups with the tools they need to beautifully tailer individual program information to cater to the appropriate audience, while the school’s communications team ensures governance and brand consistency across the website.
