Built on the Umbraco content management system, Cabin is a simple project management tool for sharing meeting minutes, loosely tracking tasks, and providing awareness of noteworthy events.

This simple and clean interface is reinforced by a modular design system, keeping scalability in mind to build upon as new features are added.
