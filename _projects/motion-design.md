**I love animation and using motion** to communicate and guide an audience. 

## Character animation

I wanted to truly understand and apply the fundamentals of animation in my own work, and I found that character animation is one of the toughest forms of animation to learn and become proficient at. In Fall 2022, I enrolled in the 18-month 3D character animation program at [Animation Mentor](https://www.animationmentor.com/) where I completed the **animation basics**, **body mechanics**, and **advanced body mechanics** courses. 

I have a firm grasp on the 12 principles of animation along with an eye for intricacies that I apply to animating 3D characters and to UI motion design.
